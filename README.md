### Space Shuttle Apollo 11, powered by 1969's ancient computer hardware, attempts an emergency HTTP API call from lunar orbit to Earth!

...
Somewhere in space, a sudden Apollo 11 Request:
 _"Houston, we have an ... an ENDPOINT!"_ 
###
Earth, USA, Houston,  Response: 
_"Roger that, Apollo 11. Your HTTP status is 200 OK. Sending back the requested JSON Moon data!"_

Well, it's just my little .NET C# CLI API app â€“ for testing purposes, of course.
Yes, even from the classic MS-DOS black-and-white console, you can handle cutting-edge modern web HTTP protocol data.

**And the API content in my app? Fetching well-known JSONPlaceholder users data and the Czech National Bank's current currency exchange rate list.**
###
The executable file of the application, "httpClient_api.exe", is attached, of course.

Please, click the green "Code" button, then select "Download ZIP."
